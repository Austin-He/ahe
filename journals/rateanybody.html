    April 16th 2025. I reported somebody for doing something illegal 
    and intended to not let the person I reported know I did it until I left.
    Then I told the other people invovled, and they agreed we were in a shitty position, 
    except for one person who ratted me out.
    <br>
    I was quite surprised, although I should have known better. I thought I should notify them so when
    things happened as a result of the report (it's under investigation and things will happen soon),
    they would know what was going on. But I really should not have told them at all.
    <br>
    Naturally, I wanted to get back at the person who ratted me out, but couldn't think of any 
    sensible way to do this.
    <br>
    Then I had an inspiration to make some platform where people could
    rate and review each other. I would rate him a 0/10 for trustworthiness.
    I looked a bit into the history of similar apps (and they were incredibly toxic).
    <br>
    Anyways, somehow the domain rateanybody.com was available for $10 so I bought it, and now theres a temprorary
    landing page up, and I'm working on it, although it'll set me back on the meta-rl thing by a while.
    I intend to get a working version together by the end of this week, and do some improvements later as needed.
    <br>
    I'm trying to get it to work with Arweave, where everything is stored
    permanently and immutably. This is beauitiful. Even if I take down my site, the
    ratings and reviews of people can still be accessed, 
    as long as they use the right queries to find them.
    <br>
    I shouldn't be on the hook for anything, since I only help people search for things, and 
    don't store or have control over any of the data.
