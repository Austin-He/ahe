    it has been longer than I intended since I wrote something here.  my laptop stopped working. fortunately I still have With around 2 months of warranty left.
    it took a while to get it fixed, and I rewened 2 more years of warranty and accident protection for 200 usd, which is certainly cheaper than a new laptop.
    
    much has happened since then. I joined an effort by a friend to work on a project.
    it's kind of interesting in some ways. Part of the motivation is because I moved out and needed some new place to live,
    which is now their living room.

    most of the work is boring. some grant for cloud credits through aws activate is still under review and I have a few applications for things 
    still pending and another few yet to be finished. I have a plane ticket back to Beijing on the 13th with free cancellation, and 
    my collaborator will pay off my plane tickets, so it will be free. and if my paper is accepeted for a talk at qec25, I will also get a free trip
    to yale this summer to take me back to the us. I think staying in the bay area would be more eventful.

    <br> something that I'm trying to get together with their project is being able to do more things with voice control.
    I can't quite explain it, but I think it's a lot less taxing for me to do this. I have a basic setup and its great to just talk
    and watch things happen on the tv. I can code for a lot longer without getting tired by using this sometimes, although many tasks are still poorly suited to this.
