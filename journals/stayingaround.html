    May 28 2025. I think I will be here for a while.
    More code has been tossed out than I thought, and nothing has seen the light of day yet. I already have a computer co-use demo which I think is halfway decent,
    although the api costs are quite high. We tried claude code and it was quite a lot better than cursor,
    and I now trust ai generated code more when guided to not do anything too hacky. I think it won't be long before
    I join them and think about product and business stuff most of the time here.

    For the meta-rl effort, I have started to focus on making it distributed and allow for pooling compute.
    the odf program accepeted me, so I will join them gratefully and they have taken my 1000 usd, but I will get 
    I think around 200k to 300k in cloud credits, so I think it's worth it, although other accelerators are more
    intertwined with your sucesss since they take equity and give you some money, so they seem to have more reason to want you to succeed.

    We ate edibles and I recalled what its like to be high, which I haven't for a long time. It's an interesting state of mind,
    and I remembered why I decided to end my experimenting with it before. I stumbled upon the mr x article by Carl Sagan,
    it was on the organism.earth website which was quite an interesting place, I think more so when intoxicated.
    The way some of the text was highlighted on the site also felt interesting. It felt like a prompt injection,
    and the memetics stuff is interesting.
