<p> This started around may 2024. 
    I thought quantum error correction was interesting, so I started working on it.
    quantum error correction is good for many things. From a practical perspective, it's necessary for building
    a quantum computer. From a theoretical perspective, 
    there's many deep connections to physics and theoretical computer science and whatnot.

    One of the first and only opensource projects on using rl to discover quantum error correcting codes I found was by Jan, 
    and I messed around with a bit and sent him an email. He replied, and a year later after I got my paper out I emailed him again and we chatted.
    He completely forgot about my first email and my existence lol, but now we keep in touch.
    His work used circuit level representation, and he wrote up a custom jax simulator which was very fast.
    They briefly mentioned how one could constrain weight, but their method didn't work. The released a new paper
    on pi day which cited mine, and it's tied with a paper by my collaborator for being the first paper to cite mine.
    I'll count my collaborator as first, since for some reason Jan's paper doesnt show up in google scholar because
    they used some different bib style or something.

    Anyways, I tried a ton of stuff and sometime in June 2024 I came across this weight reduction paper by hastings way back around 2016.
    I tried out a bunch of stuff in between with different representations from using the boundary maps from chain complexes
    derived from some simplicial complexes, plain bitflips, actions of the symplectic group on projections of maximal isotropic subspaces, and some other stuff.
    they all didn't work so I finally tried the weight reduction idea and all the results magically came out in the span of 3 weeks.
    Although I was up until like 4am working everday during this time, so it was less magical and more through shear force of will.
    The implementation part happened around late november and early december of 2024.
    First draft was ready mid december and we put it on arxiv on feb 20 2025. 
    It took doing an unfathomable amount of stupid things along the way to get it done, since I was on my own and without much guidance (not that I wanted any).
    I learned many lessons, but somehow still do stupid things that I told myself to never do again at some point. Also I've become very disapointed 
    in the state of rl algorithms so I'm starting work on learned optimizers, since I think the only way to learn smartly is to learn to learn.
