<p>this started around may 2024. 
    thought quantum error correction was interesting, so I started to working on it.
    One of the first and only opensource projects I found was by Jan, and I messed around with a bit.
    Later tried a ton of stuff and came across this weight reduction paper sometime in June 2024. 
    Took until late november 2024 to get it implemented. and crammed out a first draft around december, 
    put on arxiv on feb 20 2025. Will continue later.
