<p>this started around may 2024. 
    thought quantum error correction was interesting, so I started to working on it.
    One of the first and only opensource projects I found was by Jan, and I messed around with a bit.
    Later tried a ton of stuff and came across this weight reduction paper sometime in June 2024. 
    tried out a bunch of stuff in between with different representations from simplical complexes
    to just bitflips and projections of maximal isotropic subspaces. they all didn't work so I finally
    tried the weight reduction idea and all the results magically came out in the span of 3 weeks.
    Learned a big lesson there lol. That happened around late november and early december of 2024.
    first draft was ready mid december and we put it on arxiv on feb 20 2025. Will continue later.
