<p>so I put together a website for this and am still thinking how to go about it.
    either we commit fully to resarch on this, or try and do some startup stuff.
    The main thing we'll be working on is learned optimizers
    that take in the parameters of another neural netowrk as input
    and output updates to them. the grand objective is seeing 
    if they can optimize themself at some point
    which is basically a first step towards self improvement.
    once that's proved to be possible sometime hopefully within 18 months,
    we'll also start work on custom inference hardware. 
    I'm betting that inference will eat up everything.
